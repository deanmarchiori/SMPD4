# SMPD4

The goal of SMPD4 is to provide analysis ready data sets on SMPD4 data.  

Sphingomyelin Phosphodiesterase 4 (SMPD4) is a type of sphinogmyelinase protein
encoded by the SMPD4 gene. Patients with a bi-allelic loss of function variants
in this gene are associated with a condition known as neurodevelopmental disorder 
with microcephaly, arthrogryposis, and structural brain anomalies 
(NEDMABA; [618622](https://omim.org/entry/618622)).  

Few cases exist in the scientific literature with [Magini et al. (2019)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajhg.2019.08.006) 
reporting 23 members of 12 unrelated families. The genotype-phenotype relationship
of NEDMABA is heterogeneous and aside from case-reports, little data is available
for statistical analysis. Magini et al. (2019) offer a supplementary table with
summarised clinical phenotype data of the included subjects. Unfortunately these
data are non standardised, heterogeneous and largely textual based. 

Further isolated examples exist in other papers and case studies, which have 
also been included (Bijarnia-Mahay et al. (2022), Ji et al. (2022), Monies et al. (2019), Ravenscroft et al. (2020)).  

This project aims to standardise and process this data into tidy format [(Wickham (2014))](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajhg.2019.08.006)
so it is analysis-ready and extensible for other researchers to better understand
the relationship between clinical factors discovered in the literature.
